todo:
add dynamic time steps
fix collisions
bodies should merge elastically or inelastically
use dynamic memory allocation to add and remove objects
find a way to put find force funtion inside the class
use barnes hutt algorithm
change the color of the object according to speed
use runge-kutt for integration
users can define where the space objects are

errors to fix:
not able to add more than 5500 objects
when ther are too many objects , objects seem to only be attracted to a single object
